**Project Overview**
This project is a playful recreation of a classic GeoCities-style webpage, a nostalgic representation of web design from the mid-1990s. GeoCities was one of the first popular website hosting services, allowing users to create simple personal web pages. The HTML and CSS in this project reflect the look and feel of early web pages, complete with old-fashioned layouts, low-resolution images, and basic links.

**Contents**
HTML file (index.html): Contains the structure and content of the webpage.
CSS file (geocities.css): Defines the style, layout, and visual appearance of the webpage.

**Inspiration**
This project was inspired by the early days of the web and the GeoCities hosting service. GeoCities allowed users to create simple, customizable websites, and its influence on early web design is still remembered today as a hallmark of internet history.
